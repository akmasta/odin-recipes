    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This dish is a garlic baguette, featuring slices of crusty bread generously seasoned with garlic and herbs. The bread is toasted to a golden brown, ensuring a crispy texture on the outside while remaining soft on the inside. Fresh parsley is sprinkled on top for a burst of color and freshness. This simple yet flavorful dish is perfect as an appetizer or a side dish.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pre-baked baguette</li>
            <li>50 g butter (room temperature)</li>
            <li>3 tbsp Greek garlic oil</li>
            <li>2 tsp "Dip it!" seasoning</li>
            <li>Some fresh parsley for serving</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> Preheat the oven to 180 degrees Celsius (fan setting). Halve the baguette lengthwise and place it on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Put the soft butter in a bowl and mix it with the garlic oil and "Dip it!" seasoning.</li>
            <li> Spread the garlic butter over the baguette halves and bake in the hot oven for about 12 to 15 minutes until golden brown. Cut the garlic baguette into pieces and sprinkle with some freshly chopped parsley. Serve the baguette immediately; it tastes best when still warm.</li>
        </ol>
