    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This dish features green asparagus spears wrapped in bacon, grilled or roasted to perfection. The asparagus is garnished with fresh herbs and served on a wooden board with slices of lemon for added zest. The bacon provides a crispy, savory contrast to the tender asparagus, making it a delightful combination of textures and flavors.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>12 stalks green asparagus</li>
            <li>Pinch of fleur de sel</li>
            <li>12 slices bacon</li>
            <li>1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tsp asparagus seasoning</li>
            <li>1/4 lemon</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> First, wash and dry the green asparagus. Trim the ends and peel the bottom third of the stalks. Season the asparagus stalks with a pinch of fleur de sel. Wrap each asparagus stalk with a slice of bacon. To do this, lay a slice of bacon slightly diagonally on a board and place the bottom end of the stalk at the beginning of the bacon slice. Wrap the asparagus tightly with the bacon so that the bacon slightly overlaps along the edges.</li>
            <li> Heat a pan with some olive oil. Now, fry the wrapped asparagus stalks on all sides over medium heat for about 10 minutes until golden brown. Turn them occasionally to ensure the bacon gets crispy on all sides. Finally, season the asparagus with asparagus seasoning and drizzle with a bit of lemon juice. Serve immediately with a colorful salad or fresh bread.</li>
        </ol>
