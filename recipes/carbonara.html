    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe for Spaghetti Carbonara is true to the Italian original. The ingredients are of high quality, and you need very little to make the perfect, creamy Carbonara. By the way, cream is never included in the original recipe. If you can't find guanciale, you can use other smoked bacon (e.g., pancetta) as a substitute.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>300g Spaghetti</li>
            <li>3 egg yolks</li>
            <li>3 whole eggs</li>
            <li>approx. 150 g grated Pecorino cheese</li>
            <li>150 g guanciale (Italian cured pork)</li>
            <li>2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>Salt for the pasta water</li>
            <li>1-2 tsp garlic pepper</li>
            <li>Some Pecorino cheese for serving</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
        <li> Bring a large pot of water to a boil and salt it generously (it should taste like seawater). Cook the spaghetti according to the package instructions until al dente.</li>
        <li> Cut the guanciale into strips about 2 mm thick and slowly fry them in some olive oil over medium heat until golden brown. In a bowl, mix the eggs, egg yolks, Pecorino, and pepper. Just before the pasta is done cooking, add a ladleful of pasta water to the egg mixture and stir.</li>
        <li> Add the al dente spaghetti directly from the pot to the pan and toss with a ladleful of pasta water. Turn off the heat and add the egg mixture. You need to be quick here, as the egg will start to bind the sauce immediately, creating a creamy texture. If the heat is too high, the egg will scramble and the carbonara will be ruined. Once the consistency is perfect, serve the spaghetti immediately, topped with some Pecorino cheese. Enjoy!</li>
